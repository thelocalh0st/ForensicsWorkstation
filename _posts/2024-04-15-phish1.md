## What is Phishing!
A phishing attack is a type of attack that usually aims to steal the user's personal information by tricking them into clicking on malicious links in emails or running malicious files on their computer.

Phishing attacks fall into the "Delivery" phase of the Cyber Kill Chain model created to analyze cyber-attacks. The 'delivery' phase is where the attacker transfers the pre-arranged malicious content to the victim systems/people.

The attackers usually aim to get victims to click on the malicious link in the email by using tricky phrases such as "you have won a gift", "don't miss out on the big discount", "if you don't click on the link in the email your account will be suspended".

## Different types of phishing attacks
Phishing attacks come from scammers disguised as trustworthy sources and can facilitate access to all types of sensitive data. As technologies evolve, so do cyberattacks. Learn about the most pervasive types of phishing.

### Email phishing
The most common form of phishing, this type of attack uses tactics like phony hyperlinks to lure email recipients into sharing their personal information. Attackers often masquerade as a large account provider like Microsoft or Google, or even a coworker.

### Malware phishing
Another prevalent phishing approach, this type of attack involves planting malware disguised as a trustworthy attachment (such as a resume or bank statement) in an email. In some cases, opening a malware attachment can paralyze entire IT systems.

### Spear phishing
Where most phishing attacks cast a wide net, spear phishing targets specific individuals by exploiting information gathered through research into their jobs and social lives. These attacks are highly customized, making them particularly effective at bypassing basic cybersecurity.

### Whaling
When bad actors target a ‚Äúbig fish‚Äù like a business executive or celebrity, it‚Äôs called whaling. These scammers often conduct considerable research into their targets to find an opportune moment to steal login credentials or other sensitive information. If you have a lot to lose, whaling attackers have a lot to gain.

### Smishing
A combination of the words ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù and ‚Äúphishing,‚Äù smishing involves sending text messages disguised as trustworthy communications from businesses like Amazon or FedEx. People are particularly vulnerable to SMS scams, as text messages are delivered in plain text and come across as more personal.

### Vishing
In vishing campaigns, attackers in fraudulent call centers attempt to trick people into providing sensitive information over the phone. In many cases, these scams use social engineering to dupe victims into installing malware onto their devices in the form of an app.

## Common features of phishing emails

1. Too Good To Be True
- Lucrative offers and eye-catching or attention-grabbing statements are designed to attract people‚Äôs attention immediately. For instance, many claim that you have won an iPhone, a lottery, or some other lavish prize. Just don't click on any suspicious emails. Remember that if it seems to good to be true, it probably is!
2. Sense of Urgency 
- A favorite tactic amongst cybercriminals is to ask you to act fast because the super deals are only for a limited time. Some of them will even tell you that you have only a few minutes to respond. When you come across these kinds of emails, it's best to just ignore them. Sometimes, they will tell you that your account will be suspended unless you update your personal details immediately. Most reliable organizations give ample time before they terminate an account and they never ask patrons to update personal details over the Internet. When in doubt, visit the source directly rather than clicking a link in an email.
3. Hyperlinks 
- A link may not be all it appears to be. Hovering over a link shows you the actual URL where you will be directed upon clicking on it. It could be completely different or it could be a popular website with a misspelling, for instance www.bankofarnerica.com - the 'm' is actually an 'r' and an 'n', so look carefully.
Attachments - If you see an attachment in an email you weren't expecting or that doesn't make sense, don't open it! They often contain payloads like ransomware or other viruses. The only file type that is always safe to click on is a .txt file.
4. Unusual Sender 
- Whether it looks like it's from someone you don't know or someone you do know, if anything seems out of the ordinary, unexpected, out of character or just suspicious in general don't click on it!
